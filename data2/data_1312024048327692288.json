An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)‚Äìbase as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, ave","unwound_url":"https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e19992/"}]},"conversation_id":"1312508857923428352","author_id":"1049372113264623629","source":"cardiogramapp","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1310939801248583680"}],"possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"RT @jmirpub: @GAMONetwork @HWWPotts @HannahL100 @abifisher99 @BetterPoints Great paper.
