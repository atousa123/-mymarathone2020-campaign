An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed.

Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.
