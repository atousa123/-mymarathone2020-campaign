Both low mitochondrial fitness and low CRF may be important risk factors for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, possibly representing a link between established risk factors like age and various chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.

Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols.

Methods The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols.

All adults should undertake 150‚Äì300‚Äâmin of moderate-intensity, or 75‚Äì150‚Äâmin of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week.
