Social media analytics in raising awareness of physical inactivity as a cardiovascular disease risk factor in Australia: Case study of #mymarathon2020 campaign


Physical inactivity is recognised as the leading modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 
Strong evidence shows that improving lifestyle behaviors is a key factor in risk management of CVDs and raising awareness is crucial to 
encourage individuals to make changes toward establishing healthy habits. However, limited studies have evaluated social media campaigns 
to raise awareness of physical activity to deliver social behavior change. Existing research has applied the Transtheoretical model (TTM) 
to promote physical activities using traditional methods but no study used social media data as a dynamic source of information to manage 
CVD risk factors. There is a need to quantify behavior change models and move from a static model to a dynamic model to identify which type 
of interactions most support sustained engagement in the process of behaviour change. This study goes beyond surveys and interviews and analyses 
Twitter data based on stages of TTM behavior change to investigate the #mymarathon2020 awareness campaign to promote physical activity behaviours 
in Australia. The results of an exploratory statistical descriptive analysis of 23,535 tweets between (Aug 01-Dec 31, 2020) indicate a total positive 
association between raising awareness and engagement of users. Sentiment analysis indicates that the majority of people express strong positive emotions
related to physical activities. In general, the change of attitudes and knowledge seems promising during the campaign although the long term pattern of 
behavioral change remains unknown.
