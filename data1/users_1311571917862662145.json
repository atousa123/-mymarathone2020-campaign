An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)–base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, ave","unwound_url":"https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e19992/"},{"start":112,"end":135,"url":"https://t.co/Jg23tmNBx4","expanded_url":"https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19787/","display_url":"jmir.org/2020/6/e19787/"}],"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":12,"username":"GAMONetwork","id":"793123796819537920"},{"start":13,"end":22,"username":"HWWPotts","id":"1960957782"},{"start":23,"end":34,"username":"HannahL100","id":"823478335686799360"},{"start":35,"end":47,"username":"abifisher99","id":"288315277"},{"start":48,"end":61,"username":"BetterPoints","id":"192869394"}],"annotations":{}},"id":"1310939801248583680","source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","author_id":"28618231","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"conversation_id":"1310849303091580928","geo":{},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1310849303091580928"}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"793123796819537920"},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":2,"like_count":5,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2020-09-30T13:26:01.000Z","text":"Never Too Late to See Exercise Benefit? #exercise #physicalactivity #lifestylemedicine #prevention https://t.co/u5C1NlqNRe","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":40,"end":49,"tag":"exercise"},{"start":50,"end":67,"tag":"physicalactivity"},{"start":68,"end":86,"tag":"lifestylemedicine"},{"start":87,"end":98,"tag":"prevention"}],"urls":[{"start":99,"end":122,"url":"https://t.co/u5C1NlqNRe","expanded_url":"https://buff.ly/3kGLYBb","display_url":"buff.ly/3kGLYBb"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":{}},"id":"1311296241754669062","source":"Buffer","lang":"en","author_id":"41088046","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"conversation_id":"1311296241754669062","geo":{},"referenced_tweets":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":5,"like_count":28,"quote_count":6},"created_at":"2020-10-03T14:38:44.000Z","text":"As the next #MScNPAPH cohort starts at @UoBrisSPS, some of us new alumni have been reflecting on a Year Well Spent - &amp; what we wished we'd known.
