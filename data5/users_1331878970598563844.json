Both low mitochondrial fitness and low CRF may be important risk factors for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, possibly representing a link between established risk factors like age and various chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.

Methods The update of the WHO guideline recommendations for children and adolescents utilized and systematically updated the evidence syntheses on physical activity and sedentary behaviour conducted for the 2016 Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth, the 2019 Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Young People (5‚Äì17‚Äâyears), and the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, Second Edition.
