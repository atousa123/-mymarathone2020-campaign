A scoping review of physical activity messaging","description":"Background Understanding how to create and deliver effective physical activity (PA) messages for and to various population subgroups may play a role in increasing population PA levels. This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of what is known about PA messaging and highlight key research gaps. Methods We followed a 5-stage protocol proposed by Arksey & O’Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews checklist. Stage 1: research questions were identified. Stage 2: we identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases, contacting existing networks and hand searching reference lists. Stage 3: studies were screened in Covidence™ software. Stage 4: study data were extracted and charted. Stage 5: findings from included studies were collated, summarised and reported in two ways: (1) a descriptive numerical analysis providing insight into extent, nature and distribution of the included studies, and (2","unwound_url":"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3"}],"annotations":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":10,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1311571262158909441"}],"author_id":"1728984985","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"RT @narrowboat_paul: It was the first main finding from @Chlobobs_ recent review on #PhysicalActivity messaging\n\nhttps://t.co/xT2piLMIsE\n\n\"…","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter for iPhone","created_at":"2020-10-01T07:51:24.000Z","id":"1311574419509325826","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1311574419509325826","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":84,"end":101,"tag":"PhysicalActivity"}],"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":19,"username":"narrowboat_paul","id":"55176003"},{"start":56,"end":66,"username":"Chlobobs_","id":"922191867705520134"}],"urls":[{"start":113,"end":136,"url":"https://t.co/xT2piLMIsE","expanded_url":"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3","display_url":"ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.11…"}],"annotations":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":10,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1311571262158909441"}],"author_id":"922191867705520134","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"RT @narrowboat_paul: It was the first main finding from @Chlobobs_ recent review on #PhysicalActivity messaging\n\nhttps://t.co/xT2piLMIsE\n\n\"…","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter for iPhone","created_at":"2020-10-01T07:50:38.000Z","id":"1311574230123900928","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1311574230123900928","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":84,"end":101,"tag":"PhysicalActivity"}],"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":19,"username":"narrowboat_paul","id":"55176003"},{"start":56,"end":66,"username":"Chlobobs_","id":"922191867705520134"}],"urls":[{"start":113,"end":136,"url":"https://t.co/xT2piLMIsE","expanded_url":"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3","display_url":"ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.11…"}],"annotations":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":10,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1311571262158909441"}],"author_id":"932646247818780672","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"RT @narrowboat_paul: It was the first main finding from @Chlobobs_ recent review on #PhysicalActivity messaging\n\nhttps://t.co/xT2piLMIsE\n\n\"…","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2020-10-01T07:48:28.000Z","id":"1311573681525665793","lang":"en","conversation_id":"1311573681525665793","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":84,"end":101,"tag":"PhysicalActivity"}],"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":19,"username":"narrowboat_paul","id":"55176003"},{"start":56,"end":66,"username":"Chlobobs_","id":"922191867705520134"}],"urls":[{"start":113,"end":136,"url":"https://t.co/xT2piLMIsE","expanded_url":"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-020-00954-3","display_url":"ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.11…"}],"annotations":{}},"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":10,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1311571262158909441"}],"author_id":"256921454","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"geo":{}},{"text":"RT @SirStanleyMatth: Physical activity is known to encourage both innovation and creativity.
