Both low mitochondrial fitness and low CRF may be important risk factors for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, possibly representing a link between established risk factors like age and various chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Mitochondria are cellular power generators and regulators of metabolism and are critically involved in the antiviral host response.2 One important component in the innate immune defence is the","unwound_url":"https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/8/413"}]},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1332007807252639746","source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"es","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":0,"like_count":4,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2020-11-26T17:06:23.000Z","id":"1332007807252639746","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"text":"Excellent editorial on kmportance #PhysicalActivity mitochondrial #fitness in enhancing immmne response in #COVID19 times, by @GregoireMillet1 @JohBurtscher \nüëçüèªüëèüèª\nhttps://t.co/lww7L6unN5","author_id":"450789830","geo":{},"referenced_tweets":{}},{"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":47,"end":55,"tag":"COVID19"},{"start":59,"end":70,"tag":"youthsport"},{"start":89,"end":106,"tag":"physicalactivity"},{"start":211,"end":224,"tag":"mentalhealth"},{"start":226,"end":235,"tag":"ACSMATPC"}],"annotations":{},"mentions":{},"urls":{}},"possibly_sensitive":false,"conversation_id":"1335286596967469056","source":"Twitter Web App","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":4,"reply_count":0,"like_count":7,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2020-12-05T18:15:07.000Z","id":"1335286596967469056","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"text":"An under-discussed topic: The future impact of #COVID19 on #youthsport participation and #physicalactivity.
