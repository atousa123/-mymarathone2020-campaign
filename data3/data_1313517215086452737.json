As older adults are at greater risk of developing disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction (i.e., dementia), healthcare costs are expected to double by 2040. Evidence suggests dementia may be slowed or prevented by lifestyle interventions, including physical activity (PA). PA is associated with improved cognitive function and may reduce risk for dementia by mitigating known risk factors (i.e., cardiovascular diseases) and/or by enhancing neurochemical processes. An emerging area of research suggests the gut microbiome may have similar neuroprotective effects. Altering the gut microbiome has been found to target physiological processes associated with dementia risk, and it influences gut-brain-microbiome axis signaling, impacting cognitive functioning. The gut microbiome can be altered by several means (i.e., disease, diet, prebiotics, probiotics), including PA. As PA and the gut microbiome independently influence ","unwound_url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3417/5/4/63?utm_source=semipyp&utm_medium=&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign="},{"start":248,"end":271,"url":"https://t.co/TMF1aLTAmU","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/SEMiPYP/status/1314144798249496577/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/TMF1aLTAmU","images":{}}],"annotations":[{"start":107,"end":122,"probability":0.8711,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Victoria Sanborn"},{"start":127,"end":138,"probability":0.781,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"John Gunstad"}]},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1314144798249496577","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":0,"like_count":2,"quote_count":1},"referenced_tweets":{},"author_id":"1108692472488775680","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1314144797133864962"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"text":"Following #physicalactivity recommendations as recommended by the @WHO, can reduce mortality risk by 16%,  according a study that reveals the protective effect of 30'  of moderate physical activity per day https://t.co/ssrdFrAHe1 @CIBER_ESP @CIBER_CV @RevEspCardiol @secardiologia https://t.co/pSGdnG1XUx","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Hootsuite Inc.","created_at":"2020-10-08T09:45:04.000Z","id":"1314139742326394880","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":66,"end":70,"username":"WHO","id":"14499829"},{"start":230,"end":240,"username":"CIBER_ESP","id":"2302877983"},{"start":241,"end":250,"username":"CIBER_CV","id":"2514762961"},{"start":251,"end":265,"username":"RevEspCardiol","id":"1497702078"},{"start":266,"end":280,"username":"secardiologia","id":"87934438"}],"hashtags":[{"start":10,"end":27,"tag":"physicalactivity"}],"urls":[{"start":206,"end":229,"url":"https://t.co/ssrdFrAHe1","expanded_url":"http://bit.ly/Mortality_physical_activity","display_url":"bit.ly/Mortality_phys…","status":200,"unwound_url":"https://www.parcdesalutmar.cat/en/noticies/view.php?ID=29"},{"start":281,"end":304,"url":"https://t.co/pSGdnG1XUx","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/hospitaldelmar/status/1314139742326394880/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/pSGdnG1XUx"}],"annotations":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1314139742326394880","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":{},"author_id":"201296675","attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1314139741252718592"],"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"text":"The benefits of #physicalactivity encompass #mental &amp; #physical elements... all the more reason for #businesses to promote and encourage activity in their #employees #LincsWHW20","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2020-10-08T09:37:15.000Z","id":"1314137773188820994","entities":{"mentions":{},"hashtags":[{"start":16,"end":33,"tag":"physicalactivity"},{"start":44,"end":51,"tag":"mental"},{"start":58,"end":67,"tag":"physical"},{"start":104,"end":115,"tag":"businesses"},{"start":159,"end":169,"tag":"employees"},{"start":170,"end":181,"tag":"LincsWHW20"}],"urls":{},"annotations":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1314137773188820994","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":{},"author_id":"41828595","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"text":"RT @Hafal_: Here's world #kickboxing champion and Hafal volunteer Tennessee Randall talking about how she thinks taking part in regular #ph…","possibly_sensitive":false,"source":"Twitter Web App","created_at":"2020-10-08T09:31:17.000Z","id":"1314136272974360577","entities":{"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":10,"username":"Hafal_","id":"214079026"}],"hashtags":[{"start":25,"end":36,"tag":"kickboxing"}],"urls":{},"annotations":[{"start":50,"end":54,"probability":0.3473,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Hafal"},{"start":66,"end":82,"probability":0.4725,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Tennessee Randall"}]},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1314136272974360577","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":3,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1314132173755092992"}],"author_id":"2859194177","attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}}},{"text":"It’s always so fun having a socially distanced PE lesson with @CPS_ClassFS on our huge tiger turf.
