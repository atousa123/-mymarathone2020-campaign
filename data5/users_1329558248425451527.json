However, previous studies have mostly used self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs. There is a need for more insight into the directionality and duration of this association. The current study was the first to investigate whether an increase in physical activity leads to happiness and whether adolescents become more physically active when they are happier. These two effects were studied between (on a day-to-day basis) and within days (on an hour-to-hour basis). Methods The study used data from the MyMovez project in which 1484 adolescents between the ages of 8 and 17‚Äâyears wore an accelerometer on their wrist and answered experience sampling questions on happiness at random moments during the day for several weeks in 2016‚Äì2018.
