This scoping review aimed to provide an overview of what is known about PA messaging and highlight key research gaps. Methods We followed a 5-stage protocol proposed by Arksey & O‚ÄôMalley and the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews checklist. Stage 1: research questions were identified. Stage 2: we identified relevant studies by searching electronic databases, contacting existing networks and hand searching reference lists. Stage 3: studies were screened in Covidence‚Ñ¢ software. Stage 4: study data were extracted and charted.
