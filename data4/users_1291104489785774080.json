Activity 4 Everyone‚Äô (PA4E1) was an efficacious multi-component school-based physical activity (PA) program targeting adolescents. PA4E1 has seven PA practices. It is essential to scale-up, evaluate effectiveness and assess implementation of such programs. Therefore, the aim is to assess the impact of implementation support on school practice uptake of the PA4E1 program at 12 and 24‚Äâmonths. Methods A cluster randomised controlled trial, utilising a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, was conducted in 49 randomly selected disadvantaged Australian Government and Catholic secondary schools. A blinded statistician randomly allocated schools to a usual practice control (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ25) or the PA4E1 program group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ24), with the latter receiving seven implementation support strategies to support school PA practice uptake of the seven practices retained from the efficacy trial.
