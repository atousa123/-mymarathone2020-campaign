Methods We conducted a harmonised meta-analysis including nine prospective cohort studies from four countries. 44‚Äâ370 men and women were followed for 4.0 to 14.5 years during which 3451 participants died (7.8% mortality rate). Associations between different combinations of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time were analysed at study level using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and summarised using random effects meta-analysis. Results Across cohorts, the average time spent sedentary ranged from 8.5‚Äâhours/day to 10.5‚Äâhours/day and 8‚Äâmin/day to 35‚Äâmin/day for MVPA. Compared with the referent group (highest physical activity/lowest sedentary time), the risk of death increased with lower levels of MVPA and greater amounts of sedentary time.
