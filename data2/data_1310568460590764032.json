An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)–base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, ave","unwound_url":"https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e19992/"},{"start":112,"end":135,"url":"https://t.co/Jg23tmNBx4","expanded_url":"https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19787/","display_url":"jmir.org/2020/6/e19787/"}],"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":12,"username":"GAMONetwork","id":"793123796819537920"},{"start":13,"end":22,"username":"HWWPotts","id":"1960957782"},{"start":23,"end":34,"username":"HannahL100","id":"823478335686799360"},{"start":35,"end":47,"username":"abifisher99","id":"288315277"},{"start":48,"end":61,"username":"BetterPoints","id":"192869394"}],"annotations":{}},"id":"1310939801248583680","source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","author_id":"28618231","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"conversation_id":"1310849303091580928","in_reply_to_user_id":"793123796819537920","geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":8,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2020-09-29T13:44:18.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1310849303091580928"}],"text":"RT @GAMONetwork: The only study to date using tracked data to report #PhysicalActivity before, during &amp; after UK #lockdown *and* examine im…","entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":69,"end":86,"tag":"PhysicalActivity"},{"start":117,"end":126,"tag":"lockdown"}],"urls":{},"mentions":[{"start":3,"end":15,"username":"GAMONetwork","id":"793123796819537920"}],"annotations":[{"start":110,"end":111,"probability":0.8979,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"UK"}]},"id":"1310938456378540034","source":"Twitter for iPhone","lang":"en","author_id":"28618231","possibly_sensitive":false,"attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"conversation_id":"1310938456378540034","geo":{}},{"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":1,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"created_at":"2020-09-29T13:35:11.000Z","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1310664783889231872"}],"text":"RT @PHITAmerica: President Trump: Increase Physical Activity to protect kids against COVID-19.
