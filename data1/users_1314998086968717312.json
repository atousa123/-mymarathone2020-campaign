Objective The aims of this systematic review were to present the potential bidirectional associations between climate change impacts and PA behaviors in humans and to propose a synthesis of the literature through a conceptual model of climate change and PA. Methods Studies published before October 2020, were identified through database searches in Pubmed, PsycArticles, CINAHL, SportDiscus, GreenFILE, GeoRef, Scopus, JSTOR and Transportation Research Information Services. Studies examining the associations between PA domains and climate change (e.g., natural disasters, air pollution, carbon footprint) were included. Results A narrative synthesis was performed and the 74 identified articles were classified into 6 topics: air pollution and PA, extreme weather conditions and PA, greenhouse gas emissions and PA, carbon footprint among sport participants","unwound_url":"https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv/5g7fy/"}],"mentions":[{"start":27,"end":42,"username":"PaquitoBernard","id":"3834107194"},{"start":139,"end":151,"username":"OSFramework","id":"404946566"}],"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"conversation_id":"1314998086968717312","author_id":"1112943498037125122","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Very interesting work from @PaquitoBernard! \n\nClimate change, physical activity and sport: a systematic review https://t.co/dMMVEbbHWY via @OSFramework \n\n#ClimateChange #PhysicalActivity #sport #planetaryhealth","created_at":"2020-10-10T18:35:50.000Z","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":1,"like_count":3,"quote_count":0},"lang":"en","id":"1314998086968717312","geo":{},"referenced_tweets":{}},{"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":60,"end":77,"tag":"physicalactivity"},{"start":115,"end":135,"tag":"MoveForMentalhealth"}],"urls":[{"start":181,"end":204,"url":"https://t.co/F13ej8vZF6","expanded_url":"https://bit.ly/36B9n2Z","display_url":"bit.ly/36B9n2Z"},{"start":205,"end":228,"url":"https://t.co/e8nvIjtfEv","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/KulikovUNIATF/status/1314981126633644034/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/e8nvIjtfEv"}],"mentions":{},"annotations":{}},"attachments":{"media_keys":["16_1314981116550447104"],"poll_ids":{}},"conversation_id":"1314981126633644034","author_id":"737362108397060096","source":"Twitter for iPhone","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"Whether it is walking, dancing, yoga or gardening - regular #physicalactivity can improve your mental well-being.\n\n#MoveForMentalhealth!
