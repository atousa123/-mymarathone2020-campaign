A compositional analysis of 24-h time-use patterns among children and adolescents","description":"Background To examine compositional associations between short sleep duration and sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among children and adolescents. Methods Multi-day 24-h data on sleep, SB, LPA and MVPA were collected using accelerometers among 343 children (8–13 years old) and 316 adolescents (14–18 years old). Children and adolescents with sleep duration of < 9 and < 8 h, respectively, were classified as short sleepers. Robust compositional regression analysis was used to examine the associations between short sleep duration and the waking-time composition. Results Seventy-one percent of children and 75.3% of adolescents were classified as short sleepers. In children, being a short sleeper was associated with higher SB by 95 min/day (p < 0.001) and lower MVPA by 16 min/day (p = 0.002). Specifically, it was associated with a higher amount of time spent in long sedentary bouts (βilr1 = 0.46, 95% confidence interval ","unwound_url":"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-020-01004-8"}],"annotations":{}},"lang":"en","conversation_id":"1294532992224960512","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":12,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"retweeted","id":"1294280269021745152"}],"author_id":"1017163171","geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"attachments":{"media_keys":{}}},{"text":"RT @Mike_j_bond: MPhil Viva recently completed @ARU_Sport.
