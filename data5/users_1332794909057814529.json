The purpose of this study was to examine how adolescent PA changed during school closures, to identify the key barriers and facilitators for these changes during lockdown and to use this information to understand how to manage future crises‚Äô situations positively to prevent physical inactivity. Methods Irish adolescents (N=1214; ages 12‚Äì18¬†years) participated in an online cross-sectional study during April 2020, including items on PA level, changes in PA and reasons for change in an open-ended format. Numeric analyses were through multiple binary logistic regressions, stratified by changes in PA during lockdown and inductive analysis of open coding of text responses. Results Adolescents reported they did less PA (50%), no change (30%) or did more PA during lockdown (20%). Adolescents who did less PA were more likely to be overweight (OR=1.8, CI=1.2‚Äì2.7) or obese (OR=2.2, CI=1.2‚Äì4.0) and less","unwound_url":"https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000919"}],"annotations":[{"start":3,"end":9,"probability":0.9866,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Ireland"}]},"conversation_id":"1332399647609024515","author_id":"2883882101","source":"Twitter Web App","possibly_sensitive":false,"text":"In Ireland, COVID-19 was found to be both a barrier and an opportunity for #PhysicalActivity among 12-18 years old.
